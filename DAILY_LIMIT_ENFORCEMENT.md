# Daily Limit Enforcement Implementation

## Overview

This document explains how the daily analogy generation limits are enforced and confirms that users cannot generate analogies when they have reached their daily limits.

## How Daily Limit Enforcement Works

### 1. Limit Check Process

The daily limit enforcement happens at the very beginning of both `generate_analogy()` and `regenerate_analogy()` functions:

1. **Fetch User Data**: Get the user's current plan and daily analogy count from the database
2. **Check Daily Reset**: Determine if it's a new day and reset the count if needed
3. **Compare Against Limit**: Check if the current daily count has reached the plan's limit
4. **Block Generation**: If limit is reached, immediately raise an HTTPException and stop execution

### 2. Code Flow

```python
# Check daily limit
if current_daily_count >= daily_limit:
    if current_plan == "curious":
        error_message = f"You have reached your daily limit of {daily_limit} analogies. Please upgrade to the Scholar plan for more analogies per day. Visit your pricing page to view your usage statistics and upgrade options."
    else:
        error_message = f"You have reached your daily limit of {daily_limit} analogies for today. Your limit will reset tomorrow. Visit your pricing page to view your usage statistics."
    
    raise HTTPException(
        status_code=429, 
        detail=error_message
    )
```

### 3. HTTPException Behavior

When an `HTTPException` is raised:
- **Execution Stops**: The function immediately stops executing
- **No Analogy Generated**: The analogy generation process never begins
- **Error Response**: The client receives a 429 (Too Many Requests) status code
- **Helpful Message**: Users get a clear message explaining the limit and next steps

## Plan-Specific Limits

### Curious Plan (Free)
- **Daily Limit**: 20 analogies per day
- **Rate Limit**: 1 analogy per minute (60 seconds between each)
- **Error Message**: Includes upgrade prompt and pricing page reference

### Scholar Plan (Paid)
- **Daily Limit**: 100 analogies per day
- **Rate Limit**: 5 analogies per minute (12 seconds between each)
- **Error Message**: Explains limit reset and pricing page reference

## Error Messages

### Curious Plan Users
```
"You have reached your daily limit of 20 analogies. Please upgrade to the Scholar plan for more analogies per day. Visit your pricing page to view your usage statistics and upgrade options."
```

### Scholar Plan Users
```
"You have reached your daily limit of 100 analogies for today. Your limit will reset tomorrow. Visit your pricing page to view your usage statistics."
```

## Enforcement Points

### 1. New Analogy Generation
- **Endpoint**: `POST /generate-analogy`
- **Function**: `generate_analogy()`
- **Check**: Happens before any analogy generation begins

### 2. Analogy Regeneration
- **Endpoint**: `POST /regenerate-analogy/{analogy_id}`
- **Function**: `regenerate_analogy()`
- **Check**: Happens before any analogy regeneration begins

## Database-First Approach

The enforcement follows the database-first principle:

1. **Fetch Fresh Data**: Always get the latest daily count from the database
2. **Check Limits**: Compare against the user's plan limits
3. **Block if Needed**: Immediately stop if limits are exceeded
4. **No Bypass**: No in-memory variables can override the database state

## Daily Reset Logic

The system automatically resets daily counts at midnight in the user's timezone:

1. **Check Date**: Compare current date with last reset date
2. **Reset if New Day**: Set daily count to 0 and update reset date
3. **Fetch Fresh Data**: Get the reset count from database
4. **Continue**: Allow analogy generation to proceed

## Rate Limiting

In addition to daily limits, the system also enforces rate limiting:

- **Curious**: 60 seconds between analogies
- **Scholar**: 12 seconds between analogies
- **Enforcement**: Same HTTPException pattern as daily limits

## User Experience

### When Limits Are Reached

1. **Immediate Block**: No analogy generation occurs
2. **Clear Message**: User gets a helpful error message
3. **Next Steps**: Message includes guidance on what to do next
4. **Pricing Page**: Users are directed to view their usage statistics

### When Limits Reset

1. **Automatic Reset**: Daily counts reset at midnight (user's timezone)
2. **Seamless Experience**: Users can generate analogies again immediately
3. **No Manual Action**: No user intervention required

## Testing the Enforcement

To verify that daily limits are properly enforced:

1. **Generate to Limit**: Create analogies until you reach your daily limit
2. **Try to Generate More**: Attempt to generate another analogy
3. **Verify Block**: Confirm you get a 429 error with the appropriate message
4. **Check Database**: Verify the daily count in the database matches the limit
5. **Wait for Reset**: Test that limits reset properly the next day

## Security and Reliability

- **Database-First**: All checks use fresh database data
- **No Bypass**: HTTPException immediately stops execution
- **Consistent**: Same logic applied to both generation and regeneration
- **Auditable**: All limit checks are logged for debugging

## Conclusion

The daily limit enforcement system is robust and properly prevents users from generating analogies when they have reached their daily limits. The system:

- ✅ **Blocks Generation**: No analogies are created when limits are reached
- ✅ **Provides Clear Messages**: Users understand why they can't generate more
- ✅ **Offers Next Steps**: Users know how to view their usage and upgrade
- ✅ **Resets Automatically**: Limits reset daily without user intervention
- ✅ **Follows Best Practices**: Uses database-first approach and proper error handling
